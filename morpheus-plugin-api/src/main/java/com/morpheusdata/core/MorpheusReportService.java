/**
 * The Report Context Provides callbacks for Morpheus Custom Report Type Generation. This should ideally only be used in
 * {@link ReportProvider} based plugins. Be mindful that things like grabbing a database connection will NOT work in other plugin
 * types when being run externally in a distributed worker scenario. Reports have a simply object model. Firstly a plugin defines
 * a {@link com.morpheusdata.model.ReportType} which contains information about the report and available filter options.
 * Finally a user runs said report which creates a {@link ReportResult} entry. These are tracked against when appending rows to the result
 * Rows have sections like 'data', or 'header'. This can affect the display in how you render things from the HTML output side.
