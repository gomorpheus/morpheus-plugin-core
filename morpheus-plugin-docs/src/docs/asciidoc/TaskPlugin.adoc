== Task Plugin

Add custom Tasks types to Morpheus

=== Setup

Tasks (called Jobs in the UI) are useful components of your provisioning workflow.
This plugin allows you to create custom Tasks

- Create a new class that `implements TaskProvider`
- Create a new class that `extends AbstractTaskService`.
This service defines methods for task execution in a variety of contexts, described below.

=== Options

`OptionType` is an easy way to create configuration for your new Task.
Simply provide a list of `OptionType` to the `TaskProvider.getOptionTypes` method.

=== Task Contexts

A task can be run in one of three contexts:

- None/Local (`executeLocalTask`)
- Remote (`executeRemoteTask`)
- Instance (`executeContainerTask`, `executeContainerTask`)

=== Task Logo

A custom logo can be used in the Morpheus UI by placing an image at `src/assets/images/{task-code}.png`.
Recommended file size is 180 x 60 px.
