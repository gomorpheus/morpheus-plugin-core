=== Approvals plugin

Integrate Morpheus with your own ITSM solution. See a https://github.com/gomorpheus/morpheus-plugin-core/tree/master/samples/morpheus-approvals-plugin[full example].

==== Setup

This plugin will enable you to create configuration for several aspects of Approvals within Morpheus.

==== Integration

A new Integration Type will be created when this plugin is installed.
You are able to customize the `OptionType` for the new Integration using the `ApprovalProvider.integrationOptionTypes` method.
These `OptionType` will be visible when creating the new Integration in the Morpheus UI (Administration -> Integrations).

==== Policies

Policies (Administration -> Policies in the Morpheus UI) define the conditions in which approval is required for provisioning.
Custom `OptionType` can be defined for Policy creation by implementing the `ApprovalProvider.policyOptionTypes` method.

==== Create Approval

`ApprovalProvider.createApprovalRequest` is called after a Provision Request is created.
Here is where you can send the request to your ITSM.
Each `Request` will have one or more `RequestReference` for each resource associated with the provision request.

[IMPORTANT]
It is important that you specify an `externalId` in the `RequestResponse` and each `RequestReference` so that Morpheus can track the approval status.

The `integrationOptionTypes` you specified are available in the method argument `Policy.configMap`

[source,groovy]
----
String itsmEndpoint = accountIntegration.configMap?.cm?.plugin?."itsm-endpoint"
----

and the `policyOptionTypes` you specified are available in the method argument `AccountIntegration.configMap`.

[source,groovy]
----
String myPolicyConfigValue = policy.configMap?."my-policy-config-option"
----

==== Monitor Approval

At a regular interval, Morpheus checks for Request approvals. In the `ApprovalProvider.monitor` method
define your logic for retrieving a list of approval requests in your ITSM solution.

Approval `RequestReference` should be returned with one of the following `ApprovalStatus`:

- `requesting`
- `requested`
- `error`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `cancelled`

==== Integration Logo

A custom logo can be used in the Morpheus UI by placing an image at `src/assets/images/{plugin-code}.png`.
Recommended file size is 180 x 60 px.
