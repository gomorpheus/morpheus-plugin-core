== Seeding data during plugin installation

You might need to ensure that certain data (e.g. layouts, plans, etc.) is added to the database when your plugin is installed. You can use the process outlined here to "seed" that data in.

Seed files should be YAML and should be in a *seed* folder your plugin's resources folder ('src/main/resources/seed'). They should be modeled off of plugin database model classes.
=== Example

[source,yaml]
----
# dependencies
dependsOn: []
# seed entries
seed:
	optionType:
	- meta:
		key: code
	  code: demo-option-1
	  name: Demo Option 1
	  fieldClass: input-tall
	  fieldLabel: Demo Option 1
	  fieldName: demoOption1
	  displayOrder: 10
	- meta:
		key: code
	  code: demo-option-2
	  name: Demo Option 2
	  fieldLabel: Demo Option 2
	  fieldName: demoOption2
	  helpText: Click this
	  displayOrder: 20
