== Seeding data during plugin installation

If you need to ensure that certain data (e.g. layouts, plans, etc.) is added to the database when your plugin is installed, you can use this process to "seed" that data.

You will need to create a folder called *seed* in your your plugin's resources folder ('src/main/resources/seed'). Then add YAML seed files to that folder. We recommend descriptive names like _Ubuntu22Seeds.yaml_. The seed files should be modeled off of plugin database model classes (see examples below). All new seeds and updates to existing seeds will be processed when your plugin is installed or reloaded.

=== Example

[source,yaml]
