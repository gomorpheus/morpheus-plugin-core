=== Release Notes

**Note:** The `morpheus-plugin-api` is still pre 1.0 and therefore core interfaces could change between releases. The minimum morpheus version needed to leverage some plugins starts with the 5.4.x series, however anything using plugin core 0.12.0 and above needs to use Morpheus 5.4.1 minimum. 6.0.x Morpheus versions use 0.14.x plugin-api and 6.2.x Morpheus versions use 0.15.x plugin-api. Efforts are being made to preserve some backwards compatibility as we get closer to 1.0 versions.
