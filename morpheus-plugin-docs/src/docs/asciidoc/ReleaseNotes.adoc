=== Release Notes

**Note:** The `morpheus-plugin-api` is still pre 1.0 and therefore core interfaces could change between releases. The minimum morpheus version needed to leverage some plugins starts with the 5.2.x series, however anything using plugin core 0.8.0 and above needs to use Morpheus 5.3.1 minimum.

* **0.8.0** - Overhauled DNS/IPAM Integrations, Reorganized contexts and standardized formats. Added utility classes for easier sync logic. Custom reports, Cloud Providers, and more.
* **0.7.0** - Please Note due to jcenter() and bintray EOL, Efforts are being made to move these releases over to maven central
* **0.6.0** - Primary Plugin target base version for 5.2.x Morpheus Releases
