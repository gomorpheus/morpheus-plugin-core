=== Plugin Class

Following the example above, create your plugin class under `src/main/java/com/example/MyPlugin.java`

Your plugin must extend the `com.morpheus.core.Plugin` class:

.MyPlugin.java
[source,java]
----
import com.morpheus.core.Plugin;

class MyPlugin extends Plugin {

	@Override
	void initialize() {
		this.setName("My Custom Tabs Plugin");
		CustomTabProvider tabProvider = new CustomTabProvider(this, morpheus);
		this.registerProvider(tabProvider);
	}
}
----

Here we see a basic plugin that initializes some metadata (the Plugin Name) and registers a custom tab provider.

=== Registering Providers

A plugin may contain any number of Plugin Providers. A Plugin Provider contains the functionality of your plugin such as a Custom Tab, IPAM, Backup Provider, etc.

There are provided classes such as `TaskProvider`, `ProvisioningProvider`, `ApprovalProvider`, `ReportProvider`, `InstanceTabProvider`, `ServerTabProvider`, and others to get you started building your provider. For example the `InstanceTabProvider` provides a renderer, show method, and security checking method to make it easy to build your own custom tab on the instance page.

Providers are registered in your plugin during the `initialize()` method call within the `Plugin` class as can be seen in the `MyPlugin.java` sample seen above.

=== Settings

As of 0.8.0 Plugins can now have settings that can be applied globally after installing a plugin. Some users may use this to configure an integration to a third party service like Datadog, or affect how providers may behave based on some setting. These can be set after uploading a plugin in `Administration -> Integrations -> Plugins`.

Settings, much like any other form aspect of a plugin, can take advantage of `OptionType` and `OptionProvider` entities to configure how the options are presented to the user and what options are available to choose from.

[source,groovy]
----
    class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
        /**
         * Returns a list of {@link OptionType} settings for this plugin.
         * @return this list of settings
         */
        public List<OptionType> getSettings() { return this.settings; }
    }

----

Implementing the above getter method allows one to specify the form option-types of settings that could be saved by the user.

Fetching setting values for use in a provider can easily be accomplished via the `morpheusContext`. There is a method that returns a JSON String of the setting values that is up to the plugin developer to deserialize called `morpheusContext.getSettings(Plugin plugin)`. Simply pass the plugin class instance to it and an rxJava `Single<String>` is returned.

[source,groovy]
----
String pluginSettings = morpheus.getSettings(this.plugin).blockingGet()
def pluginDeserialized = new JsonSlurper().parseText(pluginSettings)
----
