== Views

Plugins may render html sections such as adding a tab to different areas of Morpheus which you can populate with your own content. By default a Handlebars template provider is provided by the Plugin Manager. If you wish to use your own template engine you may implement `com.morpheusdata.views.Renderer` interface.

=== Rendering a view

Views are stored in your plugin at `src/main/resources/renderer/<plugin scope>/<your view>.hbs`. Many plugin providers provide a convention to store views that will be rendered.

If you wish to render and return html manually you can call the renderer directly:

[source,java]
----
getRenderer().renderTemplate("prefix/someview", model);
----

Do not provide the suffix (.hbs) - you may also pass a `com.morpheusdata.views.ViewModel` into the view to use when rendering the html.


=== Asset helper

The template engine can also process static assets such as images, css, and javascript for you. Place your assets under `src/assets/{plugin-code}`.
To include them in the plugin template you can use the `{{ asset }}` handlebars helper as so:

[source,html]
----
<script src="{{asset "/instance-tab.js"}}"></script>
<img src="{{asset "/some/image.png"}}" />
----
