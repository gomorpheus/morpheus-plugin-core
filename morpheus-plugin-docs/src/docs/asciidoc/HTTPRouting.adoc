== HTTP Routing

A plugin may register an endpoint or endpoints to respond with `html` or `json`. To register your routes in your plugin you must implement the `PluginController` class.

=== Models

Incoming requests come with a `ViewModel` object populated with the http request & response details.

=== Example

[source,groovy]
----
class MyPluginController implements PluginController {
	List<Route> getRoutes() {
		[
			Route.build("/myPrefix/example", "html", Permission.build("admin", "full")),
			Route.build("/mikeTask/json", "json", Permission.build("admin", "full"))
		]
	}

	def html(ViewModel<String> model) {
		return HTMLResponse.success("Some Text")
	}

	def json(ViewModel<Map> model) {
		Map simpleMap = [serverid: "abc-123", other: model.object.someData]
		return JsonResponse.of(simpleMap)
	}
}
----

Route provides a builder to allow your plugin to easily build a route with permissions. It takes the `url`, the `method` in this class to call, and a list of `permissions` which can be built with the `Permission` builder.

The route can either return:

* `HTMLResponse` - simple text, or a full rendered view.
* `JsonResponse` - an object rendered as json.
